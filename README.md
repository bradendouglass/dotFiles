##Braden 'B', 'Bfunk' Douglass's Super Simple Dot Files..._System_

Not a whole lot of _awesome_ __Sauce__ going on here but, if you must
know...which is a good thing:

1. Vim, packing mostly heat from the [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) repo. Although the exact version is forked 
and can be found in my list. Basically, for the people who don't like
reading code, it adds a few extra (read::NEEDED) plugins and a rake task
to clobber away the useless snippets included and add [these](https://github.com/scrooloose/snipmate-snippets)...frankly because they are better

2. All .local files contain tweaks, leader modifications, and the such.
   If you do feel like using the files, this is where most of said
   "rummaging" should be done.

3. All the zsh files are basically strait from[ Oh-My-Zsh ](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). A community driven shell is what we need and I just haven't found it with bash. Plus ZSH's globbing (wildcard + recursive) is awesome.

4. Gitconfig is just shortening git's command structure. Usually use
   fugitive over Git in the terminal...wonder if cmd-line Git is lonely due to that?

5. Mostly personal use...but, I guess, if they could be defined as "sexy", pull requests accepted.
